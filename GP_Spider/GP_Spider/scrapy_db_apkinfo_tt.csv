The app uses the ABA DTT (Discrete Trials Training) principles to encourage the child to progress through the different images and labels. First, the child has just one choice to make to identify an image by touching the image, then two and so on until s/he masters the image by getting it correct eight times.  The app then moves to the next image.  You can decide how often to give the rewards.  The prompts and labels can be switched on or off.  Also the frequency of the rewards can be adjusted depending on the capability of the child. The app features dozens of everyday objects and actions that children comes across.  Great start to a child's learning journey!  This app was designed and produced by a father of a child with Autism using the ABA principles and the same images he used in his own child's development!  As a side note, the boy diagnosed with Autism at two years of age underwent intensive ABA therapy for three years before entering mainstream school.  He is now working, driving and is practically indistinguishable from his peers.  I would encourage any parent of a child with Autism to begin ABA therapy as early as possible.  You child is most likely highly visual and will learn readily from images and sounds."

Through the Delayed Auditory Feedback effect, the speaker will have trouble articulating while speaking, effectively inhibiting his or her speech! What's more, speech jammer master utilizes a feedback loop. You don't just think of a sentence and your mouth automatically says it from vocal memory. Your brain is constantly monitoring the sound of your voice in real time to keep it sounding like you want it to. Sort of like walking across a tightrope. You don't have a memorized sequence of movements needed to cross. Your mind is constantly analyzing your balance and correcting itself. This is why deaf people have difficulty speaking clearly. When you have your voice played back with a delay, your brain confuses what you're actually saying and what is being played back so that it ""corrects"" itself based off the delayed sound which then causes the strange sounding speech. So it's kind of like if you are walking the tightrope but your sense of balance is one second behind. You're gonna fall off because you need real time feedback. You will see how difficult is to read a book :) "

It is not that all are born great rhetoricians. Never mind if you are not gifted, a certain degree of effort and articulation exercises can do wonders for your oratory skills. Most people believe that those who are born with speech impediments only require articulation exercises. It is not true though. Those who aspire to be voice-over artists, stand-up performers or even great orators need a couple of simple techniques up their sleeve for greater success. These techniques are what enables them to speak more lucidly and emphatically. Children make erroneous pronunciation at the initial stages, which are particularly amusing and frivolous. However, if after a certain age, it doesn’t change, then the child is said to be suffering from some kind of speech disorder. In such cases, articulation exercises may be of immense help in overcoming and even eliminating the impediments. If a child is diagnosed with speech disorders, it is suggested that these techniques must be adopted and implemented by their parents at the very inception."

In other words, it is a condition in which problems effectively occur with the muscles that help produce speech, often making it very difficult to pronounce words. It is unrelated to problems with understanding language (that is aphasia), although a person can have both. Any of the speech subsystems (respiration, phonation, resonance, prosody, and articulation) can be affected, leading to impairments in intelligibility, audibility, naturalness, and efficiency of vocal communication. Dysarthria that has progressed to a total loss of speech is referred to as anarthria. Neurological injury due to damage in the central or peripheral nervous system may result in weakness, paralysis, or a lack of coordination of the motor-speech system, producing dysarthria. These effects in turn hinder control over the tongue, throat, lips or lungs; for example, swallowing problems (dysphagia) are also often present in those with dysarthria."

Alex Suarez, a didgeridoo instructor, reported that he and some of his students experienced reduced daytime sleepiness and snoring after practising with this instrument for several months. This might be due to training of the muscles of the upper airway, including tongue and oropharynx. Because the dilator muscles of the upper airway play a critical role in maintaining an open airway during sleep, researchers have explored exercises and other airway training that target oral cavity and oropharyngeal structures as a method to treat OSA.

As a person's condition declines, they often withdraw from family and society. Gradually, bodily functions are lost, ultimately leading to death.

This tool provides genetic referral guidelines for patients, aged 0-18 years, who are/have been diagnosed with cancer. The MIPOGG decision-support tool is not designed to replace a clinician’s judgment. A physician’s clinical judgment that a referral may or may not be appropriate should override the MIPOGG recommendations. The MIPOGG does not substitute the need for formal genetic counselling and assessment prior to genetic testing. This screening tool cannot reliably identify 100% of children with a cancer predisposition syndrome. It may suggest referrals for patients who are subsequently deemed not to have a cancer predisposition syndrome, or for patients in whom a cancer predisposition syndrome is not yet identified based on current knowledge. Alternatively, the MIPOGG may suggest that a referral is not needed. It is possible, in this scenario, that a patient may subsequently be diagnosed with a cancer predisposition syndrome with the advent of new research and knowledge, or with evolution in the patient’s clinical status. The MIPOGG recommendations are based on current scientific knowledge and will be updated at regular intervals, as relevant new scientific information becomes available. The date of the last update is published on the MIPOGG website and its associated application. The referenced articles are suggested readings, and do not constitute a complete list of all the relevant literature used to compile the guidelines. All rights reserved.

The user can later see a trend graph of his or her past readings, which tells him or her how the Parkinson’s has worsened. We, the research team. can apply machine learning algorithms to the big data we gather to draw conclusions about the nature of Parkinson's. This means you are both helping yourself and medical research by making readings on this app! The ultimate goal is to attempt to diagnose Parkinson’s through the app and identify trends in the Parkinson’s shake. To do this, we need data.
