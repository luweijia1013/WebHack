The app then moves to the next image.  You can decide how often to give the rewards.  The prompts and labels can be switched on or off.  Also the frequency of the rewards can be adjusted depending on the capability of the child. The app features dozens of everyday objects and actions that children comes across.  Great start to a child's learning journey!  This app was designed and produced by a father of a child with Autism using the ABA principles and the same images he used in his own child's development!  As a side note, the boy diagnosed with Autism at two years of age underwent intensive ABA therapy for three years before entering mainstream school.  He is now working, driving and is practically indistinguishable from his peers.  I would encourage any parent of a child with Autism to begin ABA therapy as early as possible.

In other words, it is a condition in which problems effectively occur with the muscles that help produce speech, often making it very difficult to pronounce words. It is unrelated to problems with understanding language (that is aphasia), although a person can have both. Any of the speech subsystems (respiration, phonation, resonance, prosody, and articulation) can be affected, leading to impairments in intelligibility, audibility, naturalness, and efficiency of vocal communication. Dysarthria that has progressed to a total loss of speech is referred to as anarthria. Neurological injury due to damage in the central or peripheral nervous system may result in weakness, paralysis, or a lack of coordination of the motor-speech system, producing dysarthria. These effects in turn hinder control over the tongue, throat, lips or lungs; for example, swallowing problems (dysphagia) are also often present in those with dysarthria."

Your expressions need audience! The great leaders who have ruled and enlightened the world have all been great orators. Great orators are lucid and flamboyant in their enunciation. It is not that all are born great rhetoricians. Never mind if you are not gifted, a certain degree of effort and articulation exercises can do wonders for your oratory skills. Most people believe that those who are born with speech impediments only require articulation exercises. It is not true though. Those who aspire to be voice-over artists, stand-up performers or even great orators need a couple of simple techniques up their sleeve for greater success. These techniques are what enables them to speak more lucidly and emphatically. Children make erroneous pronunciation at the initial stages, which are particularly amusing and frivolous. However, if after a certain age, it doesn’t change, then the child is said to be suffering from some kind of speech disorder. In such cases, articulation exercises may be of immense help in overcoming and even eliminating the impediments. If a child is diagnosed with speech disorders, it is suggested that these techniques must be adopted and implemented by their parents at the very inception."
